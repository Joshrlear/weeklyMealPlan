entire family. This app allows the user to quickly and easily generate a list of meals 
for each day of the week based on restrictions and preferences with the ability to
purchase and deliver all needed ingredients with one click of a button.

This app allows a user to create a meal plan for the week ahead based on 
criteria such as, diet, calorie limit, exclusions like allergies and more.
